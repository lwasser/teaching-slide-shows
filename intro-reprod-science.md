## Why Use Reproducible Methods?



> More efficient, less redundant science: others can build upon our work.



## Reproducibility & Your research

> [Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly](http://www.genomebiology.com/2015/16/1/274) - Florian Markowetz



1. Reproducibility helps to avoid disaster

2. Reproducibility makes it easier to write papers

3. Reproducibility helps reviewers see it your way

4. Reproducibility enables continuity of your work

5. Reproducibility helps to build your reputation



## How to Make Work Reproducible



> For research to be reproducible, the research products (data, code) need to be publicly available in a form that people can find and understand them.



## Who do we need to share with?



* Collaborators

* Peer reviewers & journal editors

* Broad scientific community

* The public

## The tools we will use



* GitHub: Version Control / Collaboration / Dissemination

* R Markdown: Code Documentation / Dissemination





## Four Facets of Reproducibility


_Over the next week, we will focus on the tools and skills associated with these facets._

1. Organization
2. Automation
3. Documentation
4. Dissemination



## 1. Organization

The more self explanatory the better:

* Consider overall structure of folders and files.
* Use informative file names.

## 1. Organization Pro-Tip

> A variable name that describes the object is more useful than a random variable name.

## 1. Organization

File Organization should:

* Reflect inputs, outputs and information flow.
* Preserve raw data so it's not modified.
* Carefully document & store intermediate & end outputs.
* Carefully document & store data processing scripts.


## Organization

![](images/intro-rr/fileOrganization.png)

## 1. Organization -- File Names

File / Folder Names should be:

* Machine readable.
* Human readable.
* Support sorting.

## Which set of file names are most self-explanatory?

-- from the Reproducible Science Curriculum.

## 1. Organization - Benefits

* Your future self will be able to quickly find files.
* Colleagues will be able to more quickly understand your workflow.
* Machine readable names can be quickly and easily sorted and parsed.


## 2. Automation Pro-Tip

Scripting vs. Point and click

>  Script = more time spent up front, but will save time in the long run.


## 2. Automation Pro-Tip
Time Savings:

* More efficient to modify and repeat an analysis down the road.
* Easier for reviewers and colleagues to see even aspect of your methods.
* Self documenting methods - your future self will likely forget small steps.

## 2. Automation

DRY -- Don't Repeat Yourself

> If your analysis is composed of scripts, with repeated code throughout, it will be more time consuming to maintain and update.

## Automation Tips

Modularity -- use functions to write code in reusable chunks.

* Variables created within a function are temporary.
* Code with functions can be easier to read / cleaner.
* Allows for better documentation.
* Supports testing.
* Allows for re-use of code on other data.

## 2. Documentation

Document all workflow steps:

* You can remind your future self of your workflow.
* Others can see and understand your work.
* Future "re-analysis" of your data is more efficient.


## Documentation

Code should be easy to understand with clear goals

> Document your code even if you think it's clear and simple. Your collaborators
> & your future self will inevitably have an easier time working with it down the road.

## Documentation Pro-Tip 1

> Add comments around functions that describe purpose, inputs and outputs.


## Documentation Pro-Tip 2
>  Avoid proprietary formats: Use text files (.txt, .md) that don't require special tools to open.

## Documentation Pro-Tip 3
>  Markdown to style documentation = machine readable, small file size, low overhead.

## Documentation Pro-Tip 4

Use coding approaches that connect data cleaning, analysis & results

> R Markdown and IPython / Jupyter notebooks allow you to publish code and results
in one (or more) output files.



## Dissemination

> Publishing is not the end of your analysis, rather it is a way towards
> your future research and the future research of others.

## Dissemination - Why

* Funding agency / journal requirement.
* Community expects it.
* Increased visibility / citation.
* More efficient, less redundant science.





## Dissemination workflow



Example Workflow / Tools (R focused):



* Document workflow: **R Markdown / Jupiter Notebooks**

* Collaborate with Colleagues / Version Control : **GitHub**

* Publish Data Snapshot: **FigShare, Dryad, etc**

* Share workflow: ** RPubs , IPython Notebook Viewer**





## Four Facets of Reproducibility



_An overview of some of the topics, tools and skills that we will cover during 
the Data Institute_



1. Documentation - RMarkdown, GitHub

2. Organization - File naming / directory structure best practices.

3. Automation - Efficient Coding Practices (in R)

4. Dissemination - GitHub
